# Compute mAP :smile:

This repository computes the mAP for different ground truth dataset. This gives you another way to check the reporting of your scoring metric, so it is not linked to a specific deep learning model.


## TODO:
- instance segmentation for COCO


## DONE:
- validate against ground-truth
- use for validating output for VOC formatted data
